## Getting Started

#### ⚡️ Quick Overview

Run step `#1`, and `#2` quickly in one go — Run inside local WP install's theme folder E.g. `/wp.local/wp-content/themes/your-theme` directory.

```sh
# 1— Install dependencies in your WordPress theme.
npm i @fancyapps/ui @fortawesome/fontawesome-free bootstrap jquery jquery-mask-plugin popper.js swiper --save
# 2— Start your npm build workflow.
npm start
```

In case you are an absolute beginner to the world of `Node.js`, JavaScript, and `npm` packages — all you need to do is go to the Node's site [download + install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Node on your system. This will install both `Node.js` and `npm`, i.e., node package manager — the command line interface of Node.js.

You can verify the install by opening your terminal app and typing...

```sh
node -v
# Results into v9.11.2 — make sure you have Node >= 8 installed.

npm -v
# Results into 6.2.0 — make sure you have npm >= 5.3 installed.
```
